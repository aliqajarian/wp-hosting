# ROTATE BACKUPS

# 1. Calls backup-all-dbs.sh to get fresh SQL dumps
# 2. Compresses the sites/ folder (excluding node_modules/backups if desired, but here we keep full archive)
# 3. Rotates old backups (keeps last 7 days)

# Wait, the previous logic was that Syncthing handles the replication.
# So this script is mainly for:
# - Triggering the SQL dump so Syncthing has something to sync.
# - (Optional) Creating local tarballs for long-term storage (not synced).
